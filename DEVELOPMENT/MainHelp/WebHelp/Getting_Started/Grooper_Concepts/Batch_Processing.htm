<h1>Batch Processing</h1>
<p>Grooper's content processing capabilities center around the ability 
 to process Batches of documents through Batch Processes. &#160;The sections 
 below will discuss Grooper's architecture for representing document content 
 and defining the operations to be performed on it. &#160;</p>

<h2>Batches</h2>
<p>A batch is hierarchy of folders and pages which may range in size from 
 a single page to thousands of pages. &#160;The simplest form of a batch 
 is a list of raw pages, such as a sequence of pages acquired from a document 
 scanner.</p>
<p>As a batch is processed through Grooper, raw pages are typically organized 
 into a hierarchy of folders which represent documents using Grooper's 
 <a href="Document_Separation.htm">document separation</a> capabilities, 
 and those folders are then assigned document types through one or more 
 <a href="Classification.htm">classification</a> methods. &#160;As such, 
 a &quot;document&quot; in Grooper is a batch folder which has been classified 
 as a document type.</p>
<p>For example, the figure to the right depicts a batch of legal pleadings 
 which originates as list of raw pages, but is later separated into a hierarchy 
 of level 1 folders which represent case files, and level 2 folders which 
 represent the individual pleadings within each case file.</p>
<h3>Batch Folders</h3>
<p>Batch Folder objects wear many hats. &#160;In their simplest form, they 
 are simply &#160;containers used to organize other objects in a batch. 
 &#160;Folders can be manually created by users in the Batch Viewer Control, 
 or they may be created automatically by Unattended Activities such as 
 Separation. &#160;Folders can be used to organize a batch into any number 
 of hierarchical levels. &#160;</p>
<h4>Folder Classification</h4>
<p>Folders have a Content Type property which can be set to classify the 
 folder as a specific content type. &#160;Folders may be classified manually 
 by users, or automatically by Unattended Activities such as Classify Folders.</p>
<p>When a content type is assigned to a folder, the following changes occur:</p>
<ul style="list-style: disc;">
	<li>If the content type is document-based, the folder will be represented 
	 with a document icon rather than a folder icon.</li>
	<li>If the content type has a Data Model, then the folder will be initialized 
	 with index data, allowing it to be processed by the Extraction and 
	 Data Review activities.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Electronic Documents</h4>
<p>Folder objects are also used to represent electronic documents. &#160;When 
 an electronic document is imported to Grooper, a folder object is created 
 to represent it. &#160;A folder created from an electronic file will always 
 display a document icon, regardless of its classification status, but 
 it is still a folder object, capable of containing page objects as children. 
 &#160;This architecture allows electronic files to be split into individual 
 pages, processed, and then re-assembled into documents later.</p>
<p>The native electronic document is stored as a file on the folder object. 
 &#160;If the native file is a PDF or image-based file type, the document 
 will be immediately viewable in Grooper. &#160;For other file types, the 
 Render Document Activity can be used to render a PDF version of the electronic 
 document. &#160;After rendering, both the native file and the PDF version 
 will be stored as files on the folder, and document will be viewable in 
 Grooper. </p>
<h3>Batch Pages</h3>
<p>Batch Page objects represent individual pages of document content. &#160;They 
 store information about the page such as the page image, OCR data, lists 
 of objects detected on the page, &#160;ScanOnceâ„¢ page display information, 
 and etc. </p>
<h3>Batch Structure &amp; Properties</h3>
<p>Each batch object in Grooper contains 3 important elements:</p>
<ul style="list-style: disc;">
	<li>A root folder, in which all batch content is stored.</li>
	<li>A copy of the Batch Process currently assigned to the batch.</li>
	<li>A set of properties which indicate the status and priority of the 
	 batch.</li>
</ul>
<p>The root folder of a batch also stores batch-level data elements. When 
 a content type is specified on the batch process associated with a batch, 
 it's root folder will be automatically classified as that type, allowing 
 the batch to be indexed with the data elements defined for that content 
 type.</p>
<h2>Batch Processes</h2>
<p>The work to be performed on each batch is defined by a Batch Process, 
 which is assigned to the batch at the time it is created. &#160;A batch 
 process is an ordered set of steps, each defining an activity to be performed. 
 &#160;Some activities are Attended Activities which require a human operator, 
 while others are Unattended Activities performed by the system.</p>
<p>For example, the Batch Process shown below contains 6 steps. &#160;Batches 
 using this Batch Process will processed sequentially through these steps 
 in the order in which they are defined. &#160;In cases where the processing 
 order needs to be modified dynamically, this can be done by creating a 
 <a href="../../../SDK Help/Developer_Reference/Scriptable_Types/Batch_Process_Script.htm">Batch 
 Process Script</a>. &#160;Outside of intervention by a script, Batch Processes 
 will always progress through the defined steps sequentially.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="images/image17.jpg" alt="" style="border: none;" 
									 border="0" /></p>
<p>Each of the process steps are related to a Processing Module. Each module 
 represents an activity such as scanning, performing OCR or extracting 
 data. When the work for each processing step is complete, batches are 
 advanced to the next step in the batch process. Upon the completion of 
 the final step in a batch process, the batch's status will be set to 'Complete'.</p>
<h3>Batch Process Publishing</h3>
<p><img src="images/BatchProcessing_PublishingExample.jpg" alt="" style="border: none;" 
		 align="right" border="0" />Batch Processes are created and edited 
 in the 'Working' folder under 'Batch Processing', and are not available 
 for use by system users until they are published. Publishing is accomplished 
 using the Publish command on the property panel for the Batch Process 
 object in Grooper Administration. &#160;This operation places a read-only 
 copy of the Batch Process in the 'Published' folder, as shown in the image 
 to the right. &#160;</p>
<p>The published version will remain unchanged until such time as the working 
 version is published again, or until the Batch Process is unpublished. 
 &#160;Unpublishing a batch process will remove it from the 'Published' 
 folder, preventing users from creating batches which use that batch process. 
 &#160;</p>
<p>When users create new batches, they are prompted to select a batch process 
 from the list of published batch processes. &#160;When the batch is created, 
 a copy of the batch process is copied to the newly-created batch object. 
 &#160;This mechanism helps to ensure that changes to a batch process - 
 even published changes - do not affect batches in progress unless they 
 are explicitly applied to each batch.</p>
<p>An updated batch process, once published, may be applied to existing 
 batches using the Update Process command in Grooper Dashboard, or using 
 the Apply Batch Process command on the property panel for the Batch object 
 in Grooper Administration.</p>
<h3><a name="Processing_Scopebc-1"></a><a name="Processing_Scope">Processing Scope</a></h3>
<p><img src="images/BatchProcessing_ScopeExample.jpg" alt="" style="border: none;" 
		 align="right" border="0" />Each step in a Batch Process has a 
 'Scope' setting, which controls how work will be distributed to users 
 or processes. &#160;The scope values are defined as follows:</p>
<ul style="list-style: disc;">
	<li><span style="text-decoration: underline; "><u>Batch</u></span> - Each 
	 batch will be processed as a single task, by a single user or process. 
	 &#160;At batch scope, there is no opportunity for parallel processing, 
	 as a single user or process will perform all work.</li>
	<li><span style="text-decoration: underline; "><u>Folder Level</u></span> 
	 - This value indicates that batches will be processed one folder at 
	 a time, at a specific level within the batch. &#160;Levels are numbered 
	 starting with 0 representing the root of the batch, level 1 indicating 
	 the first level of folders beneath the root, and so on. &#160;In the 
	 example shown at the right, there are 5 folders at level 1. &#160;When 
	 the batch moves to this step, 5 independent tasks will be created, 
	 allowing all 5 tasks to be processed concurrently, provided that enough 
	 concurrent processes or users are actively working. </li>
	<li><span style="text-decoration: underline; "><u>Page</u></span> - Indicates 
	 that a task will be created for each page. &#160;Page scope is optimal 
	 for processes such as OCR or image cleanup which natively operate 
	 on individual pages, as it allows highly parallel processing.</li>
</ul>
<p>Some activities only support certain scope configurations. &#160;For 
 example, the Scan Module can only run at the batch level. &#160;Full Text 
 OCR and Image Processing can only run at the page level. &#160;The scope 
 options available for a step will vary based on which activity is currently 
 selected.</p>
<p>When processing Unattended Activities, it is best to run processing 
 at the most granular scope possible, as this provides the highest opportunity 
 for parallel processing. &#160;For Attended Activities, which involve 
 a human operator, scope selection may depend on more factor than just 
 processing efficiency. &#160;For example, the Image Review activity is 
 typically run at batch scope so that users can view and edit thumbnails 
 for the entire batch, rather than reviewing one page at a time. &#160;As 
 another example, Data Review is sometimes run at a level higher than the 
 folders being reviewed, so that the user can move back and forth in the 
 batch to review a set of documents as a whole, rather than reviewing each 
 document individually. &#160;</p>
<h3><a name="Task_Processingbc-2"></a><a name="Task_Processing">Task Processing</a></h3>
<p>At each step in a batch process, a set of tasks are created based on 
 the scope setting. &#160;The resulting task queue serves as a to-do list 
 for users and processes working in the system. &#160;In a production environment, 
 Unattended Activities are performed by instances of the Task Processing 
 service running on servers, while Attended Activities are performed by 
 users working in client applications.</p>
<p>Whether a human operator or an automated process, all workers pull tasks 
 from the task queue, perform the associated work, and then 'complete' 
 the task. &#160;When the last task for a specific step is completed, the 
 entire batch is moved to the next step in the batch process, and a new 
 set of tasks is added for that step.<br />
<br />
In support of this parallel processing architecture, it is typical to run 
 many concurrent threads of the Task Processing service for processor-intensive 
 activities such as Full Text OCR and Image Processing, or for activities 
 which may have high latency, such as CMIS Action. &#160;</p>
<p>The example below demonstrates how tasks are processed for a step running 
 at folder level 1. &#160;As there are 5 folders at level 1 in the batch, 
 5 tasks will be created. &#160;These 5 tasks are independent of each other, 
 and can be processed concurrently if enough users or service processes 
 are currently working.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="images/BatchProcessing_TaskProcessing.jpg" 
									 alt="" style="border: none;" border="0" /></p>
<h3>Task Priority</h3>
<p>Tasks are processed in order of priority. &#160;The priority level of 
 tasks is controlled by the Priority property of the Batch, a value between 
 1 and 5, with priority 1 representing tasks which should be processed 
 first. &#160;Therefore, if Batch A with a priority level of 3 has tasks 
 in the queue, and Batch B is added with a priority level of 1, the processing 
 modules will stop working on Batch A's tasks until all of Batch B's tasks 
 are complete. &#160;If all tasks in the queue have the same priority level, 
 then tasks are processed in the order in which they were added to the 
 queue.</p>
<h3>Task Filtering</h3>
<p>Many of Grooper's attended modules support task filtering, allowing 
 users to configure a filter which restricts the tasks they process to 
 a specific batch, batch process, or step in the process. &#160;This feature 
 is designed to support environments where it is important for a single 
 user to process a batch from start to finish. &#160;When filtering is 
 in use, tasks which match the filtering criteria are still processed in 
 priority order.</p>
