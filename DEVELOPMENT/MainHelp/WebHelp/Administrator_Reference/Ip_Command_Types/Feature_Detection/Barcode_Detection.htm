   <tr><td>Barcode symbologies to read. A combination of the following flags:<br />
<ul>
<li><b>None</b>: No symbology.
</li>
<li><b>AustraliaPost</b>: Australia Post 4-state barcode.
</li>
<li><b>Codabar</b>: Codabar is a linear barcode symbology developed in 1972 by Pitney Bowes Corp It and its variants are also known as
Codeabar, Ames Code, NW-7, Monarch, Code 2 of 7, Rationalized Codabar, ANSI/AIM BC3-1995 or USD-4.
</li>
<li><b>Code11</b>: Code 11 is a barcode symbology developed by Intermec in 1977. It is used primarily in telecommunications.
The symbol can encode any length string consisting of the digits 0-9 and the dash character (-). One or two modulo-11 check digit(s) can be included.
</li>
<li><b>Code128</b>: Code 128 is a high-density barcode symbology used for alphanumeric or numeric-only barcodes. It can encode all 128 characters of
ASCII and, by use of an extension character (FNC4), the Latin-1 characters defined in ISO/IEC 8859-1citation needed.
</li>
<li><b>Code32</b>: Also known as Italian Pharmacode, IMH, Codice 32 Pharmacode, Codice Farmaceutico Italiano, Radix 32 Barcode.
</li>
<li><b>Code39</b>: Code 39 is a commonly used variable length alphanumeric barcode symbology. Also known as Alpha39, Code 3 of 9, Code 3/9, Type 39, USS Code 39, or USD-3.
</li>
<li><b>Code93</b>: Code 93 is a barcode symbology designed in 1982 by Intermec to provide a higher density and data security enhancement to Code 39. It is an alphanumeric,
variable length symbology. Code 93 is used primarily by Canada Post to encode supplementary delivery information. Every symbol includes two check characters.
</li>
<li><b>Datamatrix</b>: A Data Matrix code is a two-dimensional matrix barcode consisting of black and white "cells" or modules arranged in either a square or rectangular pattern.
The information to be encoded can be text or numeric data. Usual data size is from a few bytes up to 1556 bytes
</li>
<li><b>Ean13</b>: An EAN-13 barcode (originally European Article Number, but now renamed International Article Number even though the abbreviation EAN has been retained)
is a 13 digit (12 data and 1 check) barcoding standard which is a superset of the original 12-digit Universal Product Code (UPC) system developed in 1970 by
George J. Laurer. The EAN-13 barcode is defined by the standards organization GS1.
</li>
<li><b>Ean8</b>: An EAN-8 is a barcode and is derived from the longer European Article Number (EAN-13) code. It was introduced for use on small
packages where an EAN-13 barcode would be too large.
</li>
<li><b>I2of5</b>: Interleaved 2 of 5 (ITF, from Interleaved Two of Five) is a continuous two-width barcode symbology encoding digits. It is used commercially on 135 film,
for ITF-14 barcodes, and on cartons of some products, while the products inside are labeled with UPC or EAN.
</li>
<li><b>IntelligentMail</b>: The Intelligent Mail Barcode (IM barcode) is a 65-bar code for use on mail in the United States. The term “Intelligent Mail” refers to services offered
by the United States Postal Service for domestic mail delivery. The IM barcode is intended to provide greater information and functionality than its predecessors
POSTNET and PLANET. An Intelligent Mail barcode has also been referred to as a One Code Solution and a 4-State Customer Barcode, abbreviated 4CB, 4-CB or USPS4CB.
</li>
<li><b>Itf14</b>: ITF-14 (Interleaved Two of Five) is the GS1 implementation of an Interleaved 2 of 5 bar code to encode a Global Trade Item Number. ITF-14 symbols are generally used
on packaging levels of a product, such as a case box of 24 cans of soup. The ITF-14 will always encode 14 digits.
</li>
<li><b>MicroQr</b>: Micro QR code is a smaller version of the QR code standard for applications where symbol size is limited.
</li>
<li><b>Patch</b>: Detects Patch 1, Patch 2, Patch 3, Patch 4, Patch 6, and Patch T patch code scanner sheets.  The detected
patch code symbology is returned as the barcode value.
</li>
<li><b>Pdf417</b>: PDF417 is a 2D (stacked linear) barcode symbology used in a variety of applications, primarily transport, identification cards, and inventory management.
PDF417 is one of the formats (along with Data Matrix) that can be used to print postage accepted by the United States Postal Service. PDF417 is also selected by
the airline industry's Bar Coded Boarding Pass standard (BCBP) as the 2D bar code symbolism for paper boarding passes. PDF417 is the standard selected by the
Department of Homeland Security as the machine readable zone technology for RealID compliant driver licenses and state issued identification cards. It is also used on FedEx on package labels.
</li>
<li><b>Planet</b>: The Postal Alpha Numeric Encoding Technique (PLANET) barcode was used by the United States Postal Service to identify and track pieces of mail during delivery -
the Post Office's "CONFIRM" services. It was fully superseded by Intelligent Mail Barcode by January 28, 2013.
</li>
<li><b>Postnet</b>: POSTNET (Postal Numeric Encoding Technique) is a barcode symbology used by the United States Postal Service to assist in directing mail.
</li>
<li><b>Plus2</b>: 2-digit supplementals associated with EAN and UPC symbology barcodes.
</li>
<li><b>Plus5</b>: 5-digit supplementals associated with EAN and UPC symbology barcodes.
</li>
<li><b>Qr</b>: QR code (abbreviated from Quick Response Code) is the trademark for a type of matrix barcode (or two-dimensional barcode) first designed for the automotive industry in Japan.
The QR Code system became popular outside the automotive industry due to its fast readability and greater storage capacity compared to standard UPC barcodes. Applications include
product tracking, item identification, time tracking, document management, and general marketing.
</li>
<li><b>Rm4scc</b>: Royal Mail 4-State Customer Code is a barcode symbology used by the Royal Mail for its Cleanmail service.
</li>
<li><b>Rss14</b>: RSS 14 barcode (Reduce Space Symbology) encodes the full 14-digit EAN.UCC item identification in a symbol that can be omnidirectionally
scanned by suitably configured point-of-sale laser scanners. RSS-14 alternate formats are read as well as the regular format. The alternate
formats are truncated, stacked, and stacked omnidirectional. It is recommended that the alignment  of truncated and stacked symbols be close to horizontal or vertical.
</li>
<li><b>RssLimited</b>: RSS Limited encodes a 14-digit EAN.UCC item identification with indicator digits of 0 or 1 in a small symbol which will not be scanned at POS.
It is recommended that symbols whose height is near to the specified minimum be aligned close to horizontal or vertical.
</li>
<li><b>Telepen</b>: Telepen is a name of a barcode symbology designed in 1972 in the UK to express all 128 ASCII characters.
</li>
<li><b>Upca</b>: UPC-A. The Universal Product Code (UPC) is a barcode symbology widely used in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand, and in other
countries for tracking trade items in stores.  The most common form, UPC-A, consists of 12 numerical digits, which are uniquely assigned to each trade item.
</li>
<li><b>Upce</b>: UPC-E. This symbology differs from UPC-A in that it only uses a 6-digit code. To allow the use of UPC barcodes on smaller packages where a full 12-digit
barcode may not fit, a 'zero-suppressed' version of UPC was developed called UPC-E, in which the number system digit and all trailing zeros in the manufacturer
code and all leading zeros in the product code are suppressed. Encodations are a compressed form of UPC A. The DataString property holds the full uncompressed
UPC A encodation for this symbology.
</li>
<li><b>Aztec</b>: Aztec is public domain 2D barcode symbology, formally defined by the ISO/IEC 24778:2008 standard
</li>
<li><b>All</b>: Read all barcode formats.

   <tr><td>Barcodes require an area of free space around the barcode known as the Quiet Zone. These areas should be clear of any stray marks or graphics.
Quiet Zone Tolerance defines how tolerant the barcode reader is of marks in the
Quiet Zone.  A setting of 0 will ignore the Quiet Zone requirement.  A setting
of 1 will strictly require that the Quiet Zone is respected.  Settings closer
to 1 can be good for barcodes like patch codes that are generally unobstructed.
Settings closer to 0 can cause false positives, but may be required for barcodes
that are embedded in the content of a document (e.g. Code39 or UPC).

<li><b>Upce</b>: UPC-E. This symbology differs from UPC-A in that it only uses a 6-digit code. To allow the use of UPC barcodes on smaller packages where a full 12-digit
barcode may not fit, a 'zero-suppressed' version of UPC was developed called UPC-E, in which the number system digit and all trailing zeros in the manufacturer
code and all leading zeros in the product code are suppressed. Encodations are a compressed form of UPC A. The DataString property holds the full uncompressed
UPC A encodation for this symbology.
</li>
<li><b>Aztec</b>: Aztec is public domain 2D barcode symbology, formally defined by the ISO/IEC 24778:2008 standard
</li>
<li><b>All</b>: Read all barcode formats.
</li>
</ul>
